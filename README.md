# Binary-Dhole-Optimization-Algorithm-BDOA-
This research introduces the Binary Dhole Optimization Algorithm (BDOA), a novel approach to addressing binary optimization problems, considering the cooperative hunting behaviors observed in dholes. Building on the original Dhole Optimization Algorithm, BDOA presents a novel class of bell-shaped transfer functions designed to boost the algorithm's adaptability to binary search spaces. These functions efficiently map continuous dynamics into binary decisions, ensuring a robust exploration-exploitation balance. The bell-shaped transfer functions represent a significant innovation, characterized by their simplicity, computational efficiency, and ability to maintain population diversity, addressing common issues such as premature convergence. The proposed BDOA is rigorously assessed using benchmark datasets and yields more competitive results than current state-of-the-art binary optimization algorithms. It achieves higher classification accuracy, reduced feature selection, and consistent scalability in handling high-dimensional problems. The effectiveness of the bell-shaped transfer functions becomes particularly evident in their ability to improve convergence speed and solution quality, making BDOA a compelling tool for binary optimization tasks such as feature selection. This research highlights the scalability and computational efficiency of BDOA while demonstrating its robustness in diverse optimization scenarios. 
Keywords: metaheuristic, bell-shaped transfer functions, Dhole Optimization Algorithm (DOA), feature selection, binary optimization.
